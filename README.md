# MyProject
*Heart disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms*

In this project Machine Learning algorithms are applied to detect the possibility of a person may get affected by Heart Disease.
Data is obtained from CDC, United States of America.

Data Consisted of 17 independent features and target variable as *HeartDisease*

Data is unbalanced, so to make sure the model needs to be trained properly Oversampling is performed.

Model is trained on various supervised classification Machine Learning Algorithms
Decision Tree Model is considered as the best fit model and deployed.
